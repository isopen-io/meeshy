# Test Coverage Routine — Run Log

Append one entry per scheduled run (newest at the bottom). Template is in `ROUTINE.md` §RUNLOG entry.

---

## 2026-06-14 — Bootstrap (manual, this session)
- Targeted: routine machinery, not a coverage slice
- Result: ☑ scaffolding created
- Created: `PROGRESS.md`, `ROUTINE.md`, `REVIEWER.md`, `RUNLOG.md`, `SETUP-ROUTINE.md`,
  `run-routine.sh`, `manifests/*`
- Config: target ≥92% line+branch + ≥92% diff coverage; cadence every 3h; per-phase branch →
  PR → squash-merge to main (guarded). Scheduler = Claude Code web Routine or local cron
  (NOT GitHub Actions — that workflow was removed).
- Coverage analysis source: 5-agent sweep on 2026-06-14 (gateway / translator / web / iOS+SDK / shared+E2E)
- Notes: First run starts at Sprint 0, item 0.1 (measure baselines). Set up the schedule per
  `SETUP-ROUTINE.md` (web Routine or local cron).

## 2026-06-14T15:14Z — Sprint 0.1 × baselines (automated run #1)
- Targeted: baseline coverage measurement across all suites (web, gateway, translator, shared, iOS, android)
- Result: ☑ done (iOS/Android documented as not measurable in Linux CI environment)
- Coverage:
  - shared  line 95.22%  branch 92.17%  (vitest — 22 files, 555 tests — all passing)
  - gateway line 52.12%  branch 47.16%  (jest — 143 suites; 7 suites/22 tests pre-existing failures)
  - web     line 22.37%  branch 17.30%  (jest — 294 suites; 95 suite failures: import error in shared/encryption)
  - translator line 37.09% n/a          (pytest no-gpu — final run: 18 test files, ~500 tests; 4 files w/ broken imports excluded)
  - iOS     not measured (no macOS/Xcode in remote CI Linux environment)
  - android not measured (no Android SDK; Gradle download too slow in CI env)
- Key CI gaps found:
  1. web+gateway: continue-on-error=true → CI never fails on test failures
  2. Python translator tests: if:false → completely disabled in CI
  3. Gateway jest: excludes routes/middleware/websocket/grpc from collectCoverageFrom
  4. Gateway: 3 .skip test files (ZmqTranslationClient, AttachmentService, AuthHandler)
  5. Translator: fail_under=10 (no real coverage gate)
  6. Web: 95 test suites fail due to @meeshy/shared encryption ESM import at runtime (needs shared build)
- Tests added: 0 (baseline measurement run — no tests written)
- Reviewer: n/a (PROGRESS.md/RUNLOG.md metadata only, no test diff)
- Notes: Next slice = 0.2 (remove continue-on-error for web+gateway in ci.yml)
- Commit: (see PR claude/coverage/sprint0-1-baselines)

## 2026-06-14T16:00Z — Sprint 0.2 × CI gate (web + gateway continue-on-error)
- Targeted: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` lines 211, 224; `apps/web/jest.config.js`
- Result: ⚠ blocked — gateway pre-existing failures prevent merge
- Coverage: N/A (CI-config-only slice — no test code added)
- Tests added: 0
- Reviewer: PASS (rounds: 1)
- Notes:
  1. Removed `continue-on-error` for web+gateway test steps (both bun+pnpm variants).
  2. CI immediately exposed pre-existing failures: web (95 suites) + gateway (7 suites/22 tests).
  3. WEB FIXED: Added `'^(\\.{1,2}/.*)\\.js$': '$1'` to `apps/web/jest.config.js`. Root cause:
     Next.js `createJestConfig` derives a module mapper from tsconfig paths that maps
     `@meeshy/shared/*` to the TS source tree (overriding the custom dist mapper). The source
     `packages/shared/encryption/index.ts` uses ESM-style `.js` relative imports which jest
     can't resolve without the extension stripping mapper. Same fix gateway already had.
  4. GATEWAY BLOCKED: 7 suites / 22 tests are pre-existing real failures requiring production code
     fixes: `participants.test.ts` (Socket.IO io.to not called, notifications not called),
     `rate-limiter.test.ts` (console.error not called on pipeline failure),
     `preferences-security.e2e.test.ts` (error body format mismatch: `'Category not found'` vs
     `'NOT_FOUND'`), `delivery-receipt.test.ts`, `conversation-deleted-broadcast.test.ts`,
     `preferences-categories.e2e.test.ts`, `attachmentIncludes.test.ts`. None fixable in
     test-only scope. CI cannot be green until these production bugs are fixed.
  5. PR #643 left open as ⚠ blocked. Human action needed: fix gateway production bugs then rebase.
