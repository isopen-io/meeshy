# Branch Tracking — UI/UX Iterations

## Purpose
Trace the base branch for each new UI/UX iteration, to avoid divergence.

## Protocol
1. At the start of each iteration: create the working branch from the **Last Merged Base** below
2. Develop, commit, push on the working branch
3. Once CI passes: merge into main via PR
4. After merge: update this file with the new base
5. Delete the feature branch after merge
