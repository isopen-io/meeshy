/// `NavigationView` is deprecated since iOS 16 and — critically — defaults to the
/// double-column style. On a regular-width environment (iPad, and the iPad share
/// sheet) a single-child `NavigationView` therefore renders as a split view whose
/// detail column is empty, hiding the sheet's own content and, in the toolbar case,
/// misplacing its only dismiss affordance.
///
/// The app's deployment floor is iOS 16.0 (`project.yml`), so `NavigationStack` is
/// available unconditionally — no availability guard, no compatibility shim.
///
/// This suite sweeps every SwiftUI source of the iOS app targets and pins the exact
/// set of files still using the deprecated container, so that (a) the migrated files
/// cannot regress and (b) no new `NavigationView` can be introduced unnoticed.
///
/// As of 220i that pinned set is **empty**: the migration started in 214i is complete
/// across every shipping target. The sweep is now a pure regression guard.
