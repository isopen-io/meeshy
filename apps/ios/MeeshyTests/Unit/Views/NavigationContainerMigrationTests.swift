/// `NavigationView` is deprecated since iOS 16 and — critically — defaults to the
/// double-column style. On a regular-width environment (iPad, and the iPad share
/// sheet) a single-child `NavigationView` therefore renders as a split view whose
/// detail column is empty, hiding the sheet's own content and, in the toolbar case,
/// misplacing its only dismiss affordance.
///
/// The app's deployment floor is iOS 16.0 (`project.yml`), so `NavigationStack` is
/// available unconditionally — no availability guard, no compatibility shim.
///
/// The migration completed in 220i: no shipping source uses `NavigationView` any more.
/// This suite sweeps every SwiftUI source of the iOS app targets so that (a) each
/// migrated file cannot regress individually and (b) no new `NavigationView` can be
/// introduced unnoticed anywhere — the sweep's expectation is now the empty set.
