/// sheet) a single-child `NavigationView` therefore renders as a split view whose
/// detail column is empty, hiding the sheet's own content and, in the toolbar case,
/// misplacing its only dismiss affordance.
///
/// The app's deployment floor is iOS 16.0 (`project.yml`), so `NavigationStack` is
/// available unconditionally — no availability guard, no compatibility shim.

/// cannot regress and (b) no new `NavigationView` can be introduced unnoticed.
