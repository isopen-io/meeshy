# Meeshy Android — Feature Parity Tracker

Master checklist for the **native Android rebuild** of the Meeshy iOS app
(`apps/ios` + `packages/MeeshySDK`, 673 Swift production files / ~185 700 LOC).

This file is the **anti-omission mechanism**: nothing ships as "done" until its
box is checked here **and** verified. It is rebuilt from the integral
file-by-file audit — every one of the 673 iOS files was read in full.

## Source of truth

- `tasks/audit/part-01.md` … `part-23.md` — integral file-by-file audit
  (purpose, public API, behaviours, dependencies, Android-port note per file).
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — the target Android architecture (modules, layers, SWR,
  offline, performance, design system, security).
- `decisions.md` — architectural decision records.
- The old `inventory-screens.md` / `inventory-sdk.md` / `inventory-crosscutting.md`
  were the pre-full-read drafts; the `audit/` folder supersedes them.

## Tech mapping (iOS → Android)

| iOS | Android |
|-----|---------|
| SwiftUI | Jetpack Compose (Material 3) |
| MVVM + `@Published` / `ObservableObject` | `ViewModel` + `StateFlow<UiState>` (UDF) |
| MeeshySDK / MeeshyUI dual target | `:sdk-core` / `:sdk-ui` modules (`explicitApi()`) |
| App screens | `:feature:*` modules |
| Combine `PassthroughSubject` | Kotlin `SharedFlow` |
| `async/await`, `Task`, actors | Coroutines, `Flow`, dispatcher-confined classes |
| URLSession / app-layer `APIClient` | Retrofit + OkHttp (one client) |
| Socket.IO Swift (×2, long-polling) | `socket.io-client-java` (×2, long-polling) |
| GRDB + `CacheCoordinator` (dual store) | **single** Room DB (source of truth) |
| `CacheResult` / `CacheFirstLoader` | `CacheResult` sealed class + `cacheFirstFlow {}` |
| `OfflineQueue` / `OutboxFlusher` / `OutboxDispatcher` | Room `outbox` table + `WorkManager` |
| Keychain (per-user) | Android Keystore + `EncryptedSharedPreferences` |
| WhisperKit (on-device ASR) | translator service ASR (on-device later, optional) |
| WebRTC iOS + CallKit + PushKit | `stream-webrtc-android` + Telecom/`ConnectionService` + FCM data |
| AVFoundation / CoreImage / Metal / CALayer | Media3 (`Transformer`/`ExoPlayer`) + Compose Canvas + `RenderEffect` |
| PencilKit | custom point/stroke ink model (cross-platform JSON) |
| Firebase iOS | Firebase Android (FCM, Crashlytics, Performance) |
| `iPadRootView` two-column | `NavigableListDetailPaneScaffold` (WindowSizeClass) |

## Verification gates (no emulator in this environment)

- SDK bootstrap (fresh container): download `commandlinetools-linux`, then
  `sdkmanager "platforms;android-35" "build-tools;35.0.0" "platform-tools"`
  into `$HOME/android-sdk` and write `sdk.dir` to `local.properties`.
- Compile gate: `./meeshy.sh build`
- JVM unit tests: `./meeshy.sh test` — ViewModels, repositories, SWR, state
  machines, pure logic (TDD: red → green → refactor).
- Charte graphique fidelity: Roborazzi screenshot tests (render Compose on JVM).
- Live integration vs gateway: `atabeth` test account.

---

## Phase 0 — Project setup `[done]`
- [x] Android SDK, Gradle multi-module (`:app`, `:sdk-core`, `:sdk-ui`), version catalog
- [x] Gradle wrapper, AGP, Kotlin 2.x, Compose, `meeshy.sh` build helper
- [x] App compiles to a debug APK
- [x] `minSdk 26`, `targetSdk 35`

## Phase 1 — Integral audit `[done]`
- [x] Full read of all 673 iOS files → `tasks/audit/part-01..23.md`
- [x] 696 portable capabilities catalogued (this file)
- [x] Architecture observations consolidated → `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `decisions.md`

## Phase 2 — Module + architecture setup `[next]`
- [x] `ARCHITECTURE.md` reviewed by a SOTA peer audit (`tasks/architecture-review.md`)
- [x] Module graph: `:core:{common,model,network,database,datastore,crypto,navigation}`,
      `:sdk-core`, `:sdk-ui`, `:feature:{auth,conversations}`, `:app` — build + tests green
- [x] Hilt DI graph (replaces manual `AppContainer`); `NetworkModule`, `DispatchersModule`
- [ ] `build-logic/` convention plugins + enforced dependency rules
- [ ] Remaining `:feature:*` modules created with their slices (Phase 5)
- [ ] Dispatcher injection wired into ViewModels; `Result`/error model
- [ ] Type-safe Navigation-Compose graph + `NavigableListDetailPaneScaffold`
- [ ] Observability bootstrap (Crashlytics, ANR, structured logging w/ redaction,
      remote config / feature flags) — ADR-022
- [ ] CI/CD bootstrap (lint/detekt, screenshot gate, macrobenchmark, baseline
      profile generation, Play tracks) — ADR-023

## Phase 3 — SDK foundation (`:sdk-core`)
- [x] Models: full iOS-model port — 31 `@Serializable` files (auth, conversation,
      message, community, feed, post, story, notification, friend, location,
      voice, presence, stats, links, transcription, preferences, participants…)
- [x] `LanguageResolver` — Prisme Linguistique resolution
- [x] `DynamicColorGenerator` — accent color (blend + hue shift + DJB2 palette)
- [x] Networking: `MeeshyConfig`, `EncryptedTokenStore`, `AuthInterceptor`, `apiCall`, Retrofit
- [x] Repositories: `AuthRepository`, `ConversationRepository`, `MessageRepository`
- [x] **SWR engine**: `CacheResult` (4-state incl. `Syncing`) + `CachePolicy` +
      `cacheFirstFlow {}` + `SwrCacheSource` — TDD, 5 tests green
- [x] **SWR backing**: Room DB + `sync_meta` + `ConversationCacheSource` /
      `StoryCacheSource` — conversation list **and** stories tray are genuinely
      cache-first (skeleton only on cold `Empty`)
- [x] **Outbox model**: `outbox` table + DAO, lanes, `OutboxCoalescer`
      (send+delete / edit-merge / reaction-toggle), device-scoped `cmid`/`cid`
- [x] **Outbox runtime**: `OutboxRepository` (enqueue+coalesce, boot recovery,
      outcome `SharedFlow`, ×5 limit) + `OutboxDrainer` (FIFO lane drain,
      `MutationSender`, transient/permanent classification)
- [x] `WorkManager` flush worker (Hilt-injected, network-constrained, exponential
      backoff, per-lane drain) scheduled on enqueue + FCM push
- [x] **Outbox dependency-gating** (`outbox-dependency-gating`): the drainer now
      honours the persisted `dependsOn` cmid via the pure `OutboxDependencies`
      verdict — a dependent **holds the lane** while its (cross-lane) prerequisite
      is `PENDING`/`INFLIGHT`, runs once it has succeeded (row gone), and is
      **cascade-exhausted** if the prerequisite gives up. The durable upload→publish
      chain primitive (added a `MEDIA` lane + `OutboxRepository.stateOf`).
- [x] **Outbox produced-id write-back** (`outbox-produced-id-writeback`): the second
      half of the chain. A prerequisite that delivers a `SendResult.SuccessWithId(realId)`
      grafts that id into every still-queued dependent's payload (placeholder = the
      prerequisite's own `cmid`) **before** the row is deleted, via the pure
      `PublishMediaWriteBack.graft` (decode→swap→`distinct`→re-encode, inert/`null`
      when undecodable/no-media/absent/identity) and the generic
      `OutboxRepository.rewriteDependents` (PENDING dependents only). So a media story
      queued **offline before its upload finished** publishes with the correct id.
      (Producer half landed in `media-upload-sender` — see below.)
- [x] **Durable media-blob store** (`media-blob-store`): the first brick of the producer
      half. The outbox payload is a `String`, so the raw bytes of a queued media upload
      live in a dedicated `MediaBlobEntity`/`MediaBlobDao` (Room, DB v5→v6) keyed by the
      upload row's `cmid`, fronted by the `MediaBlobStore` building block
      (`put`/`get`/`remove`, reusing `MediaUploadItem` as the single bytes shape). Lets a
      media attachment be enqueued **fully offline**, bytes surviving process death.
- [x] **Durable media-upload sender** (`media-upload-sender`): the rest of the producer
      half at the SDK layer. `OutboxKind.UPLOAD_MEDIA` + the pure `MediaUploadSender`
      (`send(item, upload)` → blob gone/empty → permanent, offline → transient, real id →
      `SuccessWithId`) + the `MediaUploadQueue.enqueue(item)` building block (writes the
      bytes then queues an `UPLOAD_MEDIA` row on the `MEDIA` lane, blob + row sharing one
      `cmid`) + the `OutboxFlushWorker` wiring (a `MEDIA`-lane sender drained **before**
      `STORY`, blob removed on delivery and on exhaustion). The durable offline
      upload→publish chain now works end-to-end at the SDK layer.
      (Composer wiring landed in `story-composer-offline-media` — see below.)
- [x] **Composer offline-media fallback** (`story-composer-offline-media`): the composer
      now reaches the durable chain from the UI. When a synchronous upload fails
      transiently (offline / 429 / 5xx — the pure app-side `MediaUploadRetryPolicy`), a
      **single** picked media is `MediaUploadQueue.enqueue`d + staged as a single
      `PendingMediaUpload` placeholder (its `cmid` rides in `draft.mediaIds`, counts toward
      the ≤10 cap, renders an "Offline" preview tile); `publish()` gates the story on it via
      the new `StoryRepository.enqueuePublish(request, dependsOn)`. Permanent failure / multi
      pick / second-while-pending surfaced the error at the time (single-pending kept the
      single-`dependsOn` chain correct). **Superseded** by `story-composer-multi-pending` (see below),
      which lifts the single-pending restriction: batches and second picks now stage too.
- [x] **Remove-pending cancels the durable upload** (`media-upload-cancel`): removing the
      offline placeholder now `MediaUploadQueue.cancel`s its `UPLOAD_MEDIA` row + blob (drops the
      outbox row first, then the bytes — unknown cmid inert), so no orphaned upload streams bytes
      to a media the story never references. UI clears optimistically; the durable cancel is
      best-effort (a stranded row otherwise exhausts harmlessly). Closes the orphan-leak gap left
      by `story-composer-offline-media`.
- [x] **Flush retries on a blocked dependency** (`outbox-flush-retry-on-blocked`): the
      `OutboxFlushWorker` previously rescheduled (WorkManager `Result.retry()`) only on a
      **transient** failure, ignoring a lane stopped on a **blocked dependency**. A dependent
      `BLOCKED` early in a pass whose prerequisite delivered *later in the same pass* therefore
      sat until an unrelated trigger fired. A pure `OutboxFlushPlan.outcome(reports)` building
      block now drives the outcome — `RETRY` on **any** transient-or-blocked stop — so the held
      lane is auto-retried; forward progress is guaranteed (a dependent is delivered, or
      cascade-exhausted once its prerequisite gives up). Closes the cross-pass `BLOCKED`-not-
      `anyTransient` retry gap.
- [x] **Multi-dependency outbox gate** (`outbox-multi-dependency`): the `dependsOn` gate now
      expresses a **set** of prerequisites, not one. A new pure `OutboxDependencyKey`
      (`encode`/`decode`/`likePattern`) round-trips the set through the single `dependsOn` column
      (wrapped-delimited `"|a|b|"`; `decode` tolerant of a bare legacy value; membership `LIKE` with
      `_`-escaping), `OutboxMutation.dependsOn` is a `Set<String>`, and `OutboxDependencies.verdictAll`
      gates a dependent on **all** prerequisites (any `EXHAUSTED` ⇒ cascade-exhaust; else any
      still-queued ⇒ hold). The drainer decodes + gates via `verdictAll`, `findDependents` is a
      membership query (a delivered producer grafts its id into a dependent waiting on several
      uploads), and `StoryRepository.enqueuePublish` takes a `List<String>`. The provably-correct SDK
      half of multi-pending offline uploads; the composer adopts the list contract but keeps the
      single-pending UI (the multi-pending UX is the next slice). No schema/migration change.
- [x] **Multi-pending offline uploads — composer UX** (`story-composer-multi-pending`):
      `StoryComposerUiState.pendingUpload?` → `pendingUploads: List<PendingMediaUpload>`; every
      transient-failed pick (and each item of an offline batch) is durably queued + appended, the
      single-pending guard dropped. `publish(dependsOn = pendingUploads.map { cmid })` gates the story
      on **all** placeholders; per-tile remove cancels only that durable row (others untouched);
      `queueDurably` stages one-at-a-time so a mid-batch enqueue failure keeps already-staged items;
      the preview renders N "Offline" tiles. Closes the durable offline upload→publish chain
      end-to-end from the UI. Surpasses iOS, which drops a pick on an offline upload.
- [ ] TUS resumable uploads in a **dedicated `WorkManager` chain** (foreground
      progress); message-send items `dependsOn` the upload (gating now in place)
- [x] `MessageStateMachine` (pure, monotonic 8-state delivery FSM) — 9 tests
- [x] `cmid`↔serverId reconciliation: optimistic Room row (`sendState`
      SENDING/FAILED) swapped atomically on REST ACK, plus `clientMessageId`
      echo-matching during list sync; FAILED bubbles retry via outbox revive
- [ ] **Message ordering**: per-conversation `seq` sort key + continuity gap
      detection + server-time offset (ADR-021)
- [ ] Transport spike: WebSocket vs long-polling on Android (ADR-015) →
      Socket.IO wrappers ×2 exposing sealed-class `SharedFlow`s
- [ ] Foreground-socket / background-FCM delivery doctrine
- [ ] `ConversationSyncEngine` — cache-first sync, atomic merge, `seq` gap-fill, bounded fan-out
- [ ] Dual `kotlinx.serialization` config (lenient DTOs / strict crypto+auth)
- [ ] FCM push (notify-then-fetch) + `NotificationCoordinator` authority model
- [ ] **E2EE** — gated behind ADR-018..020: threat model, libsignal pairwise +
      Sender Keys groups, multi-device, fail-closed, call media (DTLS-SRTP + SFrame)
- [ ] SQLCipher-encrypted Room + per-user namespacing + provably complete logout wipe
- [~] REST services: 13/37 ported as API + repository (auth, conversation,
      message, reaction, post, user, friend, notification, community, story,
      translation); ~24 remaining (attachment, block, account, session, stats,
      location, voice profile, etc.) — see `audit/part-17.md`

## Phase 4 — Design system (`:sdk-ui`) — **CHARTE GRAPHIQUE (locked, see ARCHITECTURE.md §Design System)**
- [x] `MeeshyPalette` Indigo scale + semantic colors
- [x] `MeeshyThemeTokens` light/dark + `MeeshyTheme`
- [ ] Typography + spacing + shape + motion tokens
- [~] Conversation `accentColor` Compose integration — `accentHex()`/`displayTitle()`
      in `:sdk-core` theme, list avatars + chat header dot + outgoing bubbles +
      pagination spinner tinted; full palette (secondary/accent) propagation pending
- [~] Reusable primitives: `MeeshyAvatar`, `BrandLogo`, `MeeshyPrimaryButton`,
      `MeeshySkeletonBox` done (Login + Conversations screens de-duplicated);
      identity bar, fields, toasts, swipeable rows, tag input, pickers,
      progressive image (Coil + ThumbHash) pending
- [~] Message Bubble: `BubbleContent` (`@Immutable`) + pure `BubbleContentBuilder`
      (Prisme-aware) + `MessageBubble` done; reactions/attachments/reply-preview/
      audio variants pending

## Phase 5 — Feature slices (`:feature:*`)
See the per-domain catalogue below. Build order: Auth → Conversations → Chat →
Feed → Stories → Calls → the rest.

Wired so far (login → conversations → chat, all on the SWR + Hilt foundation):
- [x] `:feature:auth` — login screen + `AuthViewModel`

- [x] Outbox-backed optimistic send: instant SENDING bubble, server-ACK swap,
      FAILED + tap-to-retry (EN/FR), WorkManager flush
- [x] Message pagination (before-cursor, scroll-top trigger, history-safe cache prune)
- [~] `:feature:feed` — cache-first feed (SWR), Prisme-resolved post content,
      optimistic like toggle (`isLikedByMe`), image collage, like/comment/repost stats,
      cursor-paginated infinite scroll (`PostRepository.loadMore` + `feedHasMore`,
      `loadMoreIfNeeded` 5-from-tail trigger, footer spinner, dedupe-append, history-safe
      freshness watermark — port of `FeedViewModel.loadMoreIfNeeded`)
- [ ] Pending: Stories / Calls slices, feed new-posts banner + post detail, reactions UI polish
      optimistic like toggle (`isLikedByMe`), image collage, like/comment/repost stats
- [~] `:feature:stories` — story **tray** end-to-end : `toStoryGroups` (sdk-core,
      port fidèle = filtre STORY, groupe par auteur, tri stories asc, tri groupes
      moi→non-vus→récent desc) + `hasUnviewed`/`latestStory`/`isExpired` (fallback
      21h)/`isFullyExpired` ; `StoryTrayBuilder` (self vs others, filtre groupes
      expirés, URL avatar résolue) ; `StoriesViewModel` ; `StoryTray` carrousel
      d'anneaux (anneau dégradé accent si non-vu, gris sinon, badge + sur sa story) ;
      **viewer minimal** `StoryViewerScreen` (barres de progression segmentées,
      tap-avance/recule/ferme, auto-advance 5s, texte Prisme, média de fond, mark
      viewed) câblé via route `story/{userId}` (+ deep link `meeshy://story/...`).
      **Tray SWR/Room backing** : `StoryEntity`/`StoryDao` (DB v5) + `StoryCacheSource`
      (port du pattern `ConversationCacheSource`) + `StoryRepository.storiesStream`
      → tray genuinely cache-first (peint depuis Room au démarrage chaud, skeleton
      cold-only sur cache `Empty`/`Syncing` sans données) via la pure `StoryTrayReducer`.
      **Comments overlay** : `StoryComment` (domaine + mapper Prisme) + `StoryRepository
      .comments` + pure `StoryCommentsReducer` (merge serveur dedupe/oldest-first +
      posting optimiste → ACK swap → Failed/retry + `received` socket dedupe) +
      `StoryCommentsViewModel` (Instant-App + optimiste + realtime `comment:added`) +
      `StoryCommentsSheet` (input accent, pending dimmé, tap-to-retry) câblé au viewer.
      Pending : count-dots, composer/publish, reactions UI polish, prefetch média.
- [ ] Pending: Stories composer + viewer richness, Calls slice, feed pagination +
      post detail, reactions UI polish
- [ ] Pending: Stories / Calls slices, feed pagination + post detail
- [x] Reactions UI: usage-ordered quick-strip (`EmojiQuickStrip`) + full categorised picker
      (`EmojiFullPicker`) wired into chat long-press sheet

## E. Stories
- [~] Story tray carousel : carrousel d'anneaux + bouton « ma story » (badge +) +
      ring non-vu (dégradé accent) / vu (gris) done ; **cache-first SWR/Room backing**
      (`StoryEntity`/`StoryDao` v5 + `StoryCacheSource` + `storiesStream`, skeleton
      cold-only) done ; **segmented unviewed-count dots** done (pure `StoryCountDots`
      — surpasses iOS group-level all-or-nothing dimming by activating the precise
      trailing unseen dots, cap 5 + overflow "+", hidden for single-story rings,
      accent active / muted inactive, `StoryRing.unviewedCount`) ;
      progression d'upload + retry/cancel pending (`:feature:stories` `StoryTray`)
- [~] **Text story composer + publish** done (`StoryComposerDraft` pure publish-gate +
      `toCreateStoryRequest` mapping, `StoryComposerViewModel` optimistic publish, accent
      `StoryComposerScreen` reached from the tray's add affordance via route `story_composer`).
      Publishes through the **shared durable outbox** (`OutboxKind.PUBLISH_STORY` on its own
      `story` lane → `OutboxFlushWorker` → `POST /posts`), surpassing iOS's dedicated queue:
      survives process death / offline, auto-retries, no head-of-line block on messages.
      **Optimistic tray** done: a queued publish appears instantly as a `pending_*` self-ring,
      derived from the live outbox (`StoryRepository.pendingPublishes` building block +
      `StoryOptimisticTray` product rule) so it survives process death and **rolls back**
      automatically if the publish exhausts; on delivery the ring hands off to the real story
      (`StoriesViewModel` refreshes when a publish vanishes from the queue). Surpasses iOS's
      in-memory optimism. **Failed-publish recovery** done: a publish that exhausts its outbox
      retries no longer vanishes silently — it surfaces as a "Couldn't post your story" strip
      above the tray (`StoryRepository.failedPublishes` building block + `StoryPublishFailures`
      product rule) with explicit **Retry** (`retryPublish` → revive + kick the drain worker) and
      **Discard** (`discardPublish` → drop the row); the reconciler now tells a *failed* publish
      apart from a *delivered* one (no spurious hand-off refresh). Surpasses iOS, whose optimistic
      story evaporates on failure with no signal/recovery. Pending: multi-slide canvas / media /
      text styling below.
- [~] Multi-slide composer (≤10 slides; add/remove/duplicate/reorder; slide mini-preview strip)
      **Pure deck foundation done** (`story-slide-deck`): `StorySlide` (id/text/mediaIds) +
      `StorySlideDeck` reducer in `:feature:stories` — structural CRUD (`addSlide`/`duplicate`/
      `removeSlide`/`move`/`select`) with the iOS **≤10 cap** (`MAX_SLIDES`/`canAddSlide`/`isFull`)
      and the **always-≥1-slide** invariant (`canRemoveSlide`; removal reselects the slide taking the
      removed one's place). Total functions — every inapplicable op (cap reached, last slide, unknown
      id, no-op move) returns the same instance; ids are caller-supplied so the reducer stays pure.
      **ViewModel wiring + strip done** (`story-composer-slide-deck`): `StoryComposerUiState` now
      carries `deck: StorySlideDeck` (default a single empty slide); the VM mints slide ids
      (`UUID`, at the impure edge — reducer stays pure) and exposes `onAddSlide`/
      `onDuplicateSelectedSlide`/`onRemoveSlide`/`onMoveSlide`/`onSelectSlide`, each re-syncing the
      editor buffer to the (possibly new) selected slide's text so `draft.text == selectedSlide.text`
      holds. Per-slide text via pure `StorySlideDeck.updateSelectedText`; `onTextChange` writes the
      selected slide. **Lossless publish across slides**: `publishRequests` emits **one story per
      non-blank slide** in deck order (pure `publishableSlides`), the first carrying the whole-story
      media + offline `dependsOn` prerequisites; a media-only deck still emits one media-bearing story
      (single-slide behaviour byte-identical to before). `canPublish` now gates on the **whole deck**
      (`hasText`/`isWithinTextLimit` — an off-screen over-long slide blocks publish), not just the
      active slide. `StoryComposerScreen` renders a `SlideStrip` mini-preview (numbered selectable
      chips; selected chip carries Duplicate/Remove, Remove hidden on the last slide; trailing "+"
      add chip disabled at the cap). **Drag-reorder gesture done** (`slide-drag-reorder`): a
      horizontal drag on a chip reorders it — the pure `SlideReorderResolver.targetIndex`
      (`:feature:stories`) converts accumulated drag px + measured slot width into the whole-slot
      crossings, rounds a sub-half-slot drift to zero, clamps to the deck bounds, and degrades to
      the origin on a non-positive slot width; `SlideStrip` binds `detectHorizontalDragGestures` on
      each chip and hands the resolved target to the already-tested `onMoveSlide`. **Per-slide media
      done** (`story-slide-media`): media now belongs to the **slide it was added to**, not the whole
      story. The deck is the single source of truth (`StorySlideDeck.addMediaToSelected`/`removeMedia`/
      `hasMedia`/`isWithinMediaLimit`/`selectedRemainingMediaSlots`, ≤10 media **per slide**); `draft`
      mirrors the selected slide for media exactly as it already does for text. `onMediaPicked`
      attaches to the selected slide (online ids or offline placeholders), the preview shows only the
      **selected slide's** media (`selectedSlideAttachments`/`selectedSlidePending`), publish emits one
      story **per publishable slide** (text **or** media — a media-only middle slide now publishes its
      own media) carrying that slide's media and `dependsOn` only that slide's offline uploads, and
      removing a slide reclaims its media (drops the preview entries + cancels its durable rows).
      Surpasses iOS, where offline media drops on an upload failure. Pending: the 9:16 canvas + text
      styling below.
- [~] 9:16 canvas with pinch-zoom + drag-pan; FAB + bottom-band toolbar (Contenu/Effets).
      **Pinch-zoom + drag-pan done** (`story-canvas-transform`): a pure per-slide
      `StoryCanvasTransform` (`scale` clamped 1–4×, `offsetX/Y` clamped to the scaled-content
      overflow) owns the gesture math — `apply(panX,panY,zoom,canvasW,canvasH)` multiplies the
      scale by the gesture zoom then clamps the translation to the bounds of the **new** scale
      (a pinch-in widens the pan range, a pinch-out tightens it and re-clamps a now-out-of-range
      offset toward centre); a not-yet-measured (0px) canvas collapses the range without dividing
      by zero, and `clampedTo(w,h)` re-clamps on resize. The transform is part of the slide's
      identity (`StorySlide.transform`, carried by `duplicate`), persisted via
      `StorySlideDeck.updateSelectedTransform` and driven by `StoryComposerViewModel.onCanvasTransform`.
      `StoryCanvasSurface` renders the selected slide's first media as a 9:16 background under a
      `graphicsLayer` + `detectTransformGestures` (glue only; the math is unit-tested in one place).
      **FAB + bottom-band toolbar done** (`story-composer-band`): the flat add-text / add-media /
      visibility buttons are replaced by a two-FAB (Contenu / Effets) bottom band — the pure value-type
      port of iOS `BandStateMachine`. `ComposerBandState` (`Hidden` | `Tiles(BandCategory)`) +
      `BandCategory.swapped` + `ComposerContentTile` own the navigation: `tapFab(category)` opens /
      switches / toggle-closes the drawer, `swipeDown()` dismisses, `swipeHorizontal()` swaps category
      (inert while hidden); `activeCategory`/`isVisible` derive the render. The drawer shows the Contenu
      tiles (Texte → `onAddTextElement`, Médias → system picker) or the Effets visibility chips, with
      natural swipe-to-dismiss / swipe-to-swap gestures (glue). All decisions live in one unit-tested
      place; the VM holds `band` and applies the pure transitions (`onBandFabTap`/`onBandDismiss`/
      `onBandSwapCategory`). +18 tests (11 state machine, 7 VM). Pending: Effets tiles (filters / drawing
      / timeline), on-canvas sticker/drawing elements.
- [~] Text elements (≤5/slide): style (bold/italic/handwriting/typewriter/neon/retro), colour,
      size, alignment, background (none/solid/glass), outline/stroke, RTL, fade timing.
      **Model + add/move/remove + publish done** (`story-text-elements`): a pure `StoryTextElement`
      (id, text, `StoryTextStyle` bold/neon/typewriter/handwriting/classic, hex colour, `StoryTextAlign`
      left/center/right, normalised `x`/`y`) with the clamp living in one place — `normalised()` /
      `nudged(dx,dy)` keep the element inside the canvas `0f..1f`, and `toTextObject(lang)` maps to the
      gateway `StoryTextObject` wire strings. The deck mirrors the media reducer per-slide
      (`StorySlideDeck.addTextElementToSelected`/`removeTextElement`/`updateTextElement`/`moveTextElement`,
      `MAX_TEXT_ELEMENTS_PER_SLIDE=5`, `selectedRemainingTextSlots`, `isWithinTextElementLimit`); a
      slide carrying only a publishable element now publishes and `publishableSlides` counts it.
      `StoryComposerDraft.toCreateStoryRequest` serialises publishable elements into
      `storyEffects.textObjects` (blanks dropped, `storyEffects` null when empty). The VM adds
      `onAddTextElement` (mints id, selects it for immediate typing, inert-with-warning at the cap),
      routes `onTextChange` to the selected element **or** the slide caption (one field, two roles via
      `editorText`/`isEditingTextElement`), `onSelectTextElement`/`onDeselectTextElement`,
      `onTextElementMoved` (drag, clamped), `onRemoveTextElement`; switching/removing a slide ends
      element editing (`mirrorDraftToSelection` drops a dangling selection). `StoryCanvasSurface`
      renders each element centred at its normalised point, draggable / tappable / removable, with a
      background tap to deselect (glue; px↔fraction division only, clamp is in the model). Surpasses
      iOS (durable-outbox publish path).
      **Style picker + per-style rendering done** (`story-text-element-styling`): the *look* of each face
      lives in one pure, Compose-agnostic place — `StoryTextStyle.typography()` → `StoryTextTypography`
      (`fontWeight`/`italic`/`family`/`letterSpacingEm`/`glow`) over the `StoryTextFontFamily` token enum
      (SANS/SERIF/MONOSPACE/CURSIVE), unit-tested per branch. The VM gains
      `onTextElementStyle`/`onTextElementColor`/`onTextElementAlign` (one-line `updateTextElement`
      wrappers, inert on unknown id, selection untouched). `TextElementLayer` renders
      weight/slant/family/tracking + a neon glow `Shadow`; a `TextStyleToolbar` (style chips +
      L/C/R `AlignToggle` + `ColorSwatch` palette) appears while editing an element. Pending:
      size/background/outline/RTL/fade.
- [~] In-place floating text editor with tool bubbles + keyboard-aware canvas shift
      **Floating style toolbar + keyboard-aware shift done** (`story-floating-toolbar`): while a text
      element is edited the `TextStyleToolbar` no longer sits in a fixed bottom band — it floats
      in-place over the canvas, anchored just clear of the element. The vertical anchor is decided by
      the pure, unit-tested `StoryToolbarPlacement.resolve(elementCenterY, elementHalfHeight,
      toolbarHeight, canvasHeight, gap)` → `ToolbarPlacement(topPx, ToolbarSide.ABOVE|BELOW)`: BELOW
      when the toolbar fits beneath the element, otherwise ABOVE, clamped into the canvas so it never
      spills off the top or past the bottom (boundary-exact, degenerate-canvas safe). The composer
      applies `imePadding`, so the canvas measurement already excludes the soft keyboard — the
      keyboard-aware shift — and the resolver keeps the toolbar inside the keyboard-free band.
      `StoryCanvasSurface` measures the selected element's half-height + the toolbar's height and offsets
      it (glue). Surpasses iOS's fixed bottom style bar. Pending: floating tool *bubbles* per element
      handle (delete chip exists; rotate/scale now via direct gesture — see below).
- [x] Per-element pinch-scale + rotate (`story-text-element-transform`): `StoryTextElement` carries a
      `scale` (clamped `[0.3, 4]`) and `rotationDeg` (wrapped to the canonical `(-180, 180]` turn); the
      pure `transformed(scaleBy, rotateByDeg)` applies an incremental pinch/rotate gesture with the
      clamp/wrap rules in one unit-tested place (a non-finite/non-positive factor collapses to the
      neutral value, never a broken element), `normalised()` re-pulls both fields into range, and
      `toTextObject` carries `scale`/`rotation` onto the gateway wire. The deck's
      `transformTextElement(id, scaleBy, rotateByDeg)` and the VM's `onTextElementTransform` mirror the
      move/style reducers (inert on unknown id, selection/editing untouched). `TextElementLayer` binds a
      single `detectTransformGestures` so one two-finger gesture pans **and** pinch-scales **and** rotates
      the element, rendered via `graphicsLayer` (glue). A natural direct-manipulation gesture rather than
      discrete handle chips. +21 tests (14 element, 4 deck, 3 VM).
- [~] Media elements (≤10/slide): photo/video import, crop/edit, aspect-ratio preservation.
      **Upload foundation done** (`media-upload-api`): `MediaApi` multipart `POST /attachments/upload`
      (`files` parts) + `MediaRepository.upload()` → domain `UploadedMedia` (id = `mediaId`, url,
      mime, size, dims, durationMs, thumbnail); pure `MediaUpload` part-builder + wire→domain mapper
      that drops unusable rows. **Picker + publish wiring done** (`story-composer-media`): the
      composer's `OutlinedButton` launches the system photo/video picker
      (`ActivityResultContracts.PickVisualMedia`, ImageAndVideo); the chosen file is read off-main
      into a `MediaUploadItem` and `StoryComposerViewModel.onMediaPicked` uploads it, **appends** the
      returned media to the draft (`StoryComposerUiState.attachments` preview row + `draft.mediaIds`),
      and `publish()` carries `mediaIds` into the same durable-outbox flow. A media-only story (no
      caption) is publishable (`StoryComposerDraft.canPublish` admits text **or** media; `content`
      sent null when blank). `onRemoveMedia` drops a wrongly-picked attachment; uploads are
      re-entrancy-guarded and gate `canPublish` while in flight; a failure / thrown error / all-rows-
      unusable result surfaces a message and leaves the draft intact. **≤10 media cap enforced**
      (`story-composer-media-cap`): pure `StoryComposerDraft.MAX_MEDIA`/`isWithinMediaLimit`/
      `remainingMediaSlots`/`isMediaFull` (the cap also gates `canPublish`); `onMediaPicked`
      truncates a pick to the free slots and is inert-with-a-warning once full; the Add button
      disables + shows an `n/10` count at the cap. **Multi-pick done** (`story-composer-multipick`):
      a pure `StoryMediaPicker.modeFor(remainingSlots)` routes the Add button to the single- vs
      multi-item picker (`PickMultipleVisualMedia(MAX_MEDIA)`), falling back to single when one slot
      is left so the multi-picker's `maxItems > 1` requirement never throws and launching nothing
      when full; the screen reads every picked uri off-main and the VM's existing free-slot
      truncation still caps the batch. Pending: on-canvas crop/edit, durable
      upload-then-publish outbox chain (SOTA follow-up).
- [ ] Audio elements (≤5/slide): voice recording (60s), audio file import, on-canvas player widget
- [ ] Freehand drawing layer (pen/marker/eraser, colour, width, undo/redo/clear)
- [x] Emoji sticker picker — **categorised + searchable** (`story-sticker-picker-search`): a pure
      `StickerCatalog` (8 iOS-parity categories — smileys/animals/food/activities/travel/objects/
      symbols/flags, ~16 keyworded emojis each, every glyph in exactly one category) owns the emoji
      data + a pure `search(query, category?)` (trim+lowercase substring over keywords or the glyph
      itself; blank query ⇒ whole scope; result preserves catalogue order, duplicate-free). A pure
      `StickerPickerState(category, query)` reducer encodes the product rule — a non-blank query
      searches **across every category** (iOS parity) and hides the tab row, otherwise the active tab
      shows; `withCategory`/`withQuery` are inert on no-op. The picker dialog becomes glue: a search
      field + `FilterChip` tab row + filtered grid + empty-state. +22 tests. Replaces the old flat
      `STORY_STICKER_EMOJIS` palette.
- [x] Emoji sticker picker — **on-canvas sticker elements done** (`story-sticker-elements`): a pure
      `StoryStickerElement` (id/emoji/normalised x,y/scale/rotation) reusing [StoryTextElement]'s
      canvas-geometry clamps (the single source of truth) + a `toSticker()` gateway-wire mapper
      (`StoryEffects.stickerObjects`). The deck mirrors the text-element reducer per-slide
      (`addStickerToSelected`/`removeSticker`/`updateSticker`/`moveSticker`/`transformSticker`,
      `MAX_STICKERS_PER_SLIDE=30`, `selectedRemainingStickerSlots`, `isWithinStickerLimit`,
      `hasStickers`); a sticker-only slide now publishes. `StoryComposerDraft.toCreateStoryRequest`
      serialises publishable stickers into `storyEffects.stickerObjects` (blanks dropped). The VM adds
      add/select/deselect/move/transform/remove intents with selection mutually exclusive vs the
      text-element edit; a "Sticker" tile in the Contenu drawer opens an emoji-grid picker, and each
      on-canvas sticker is draggable / pinch-rotatable / removable (glue mirroring `TextElementLayer`).
      +50 tests (15 model, 21 deck, 5 draft, ~12 VM). Categorised + searchable picker shipped above
      (`story-sticker-picker-search`).
- [ ] Backgrounds: random pastel, colour/gradient palette, image, looping/non-looping video
- [x] 8 photo filters (vintage/bw/warm/cool/dramatic/vivid/fade/chrome) with intensity
      (`story-photo-filters`): the look of each preset lives in **one** pure, Compose-agnostic place —
      `StoryFilterMatrix.baseMatrix(StoryFilter)` → a `StoryColorMatrix` (4×5 `List<Float>`, value
      equality so it unit-tests on the JVM); `effectiveMatrix(filter, intensity)` blends the base toward
      the neutral `IDENTITY` by a clamped/guarded strength (0 → no effect, 1 → full, non-finite → full),
      and `StoryFilter.wireValue()` is the single enum→token mapping kept beside the matrices. Per-slide
      state: `StorySlide.filter`/`filterIntensity` + the deck reducers `setSelectedFilter`/
      `setSelectedFilterIntensity` (clamp in one place); the VM exposes `onSelectFilter`/
      `onFilterIntensityChange` and the derived `selectedSlideFilterMatrix`. The Effets drawer gains a
      None + 8-chip filter row and a strength `Slider` (shown only while a filter is active); the canvas
      `AsyncImage` renders `ColorFilter.colorMatrix(...)` live; publish carries the look on
      `storyEffects.filter`/`filterIntensity` (a filter-only slide still emits a `storyEffects` payload).
      +31 tests (21 matrix, 10 deck) + 7 VM + 5 draft; +11 strings × 4 locales. Mirrors iOS's per-slide
      photo filter with an adjustable strength.
- [~] Frosted-glass text backdrops; safe-zone overlay; snap-to-guide + out-of-bounds warning
      **Snap-to-guide + out-of-bounds warning done** (`story-canvas-snap-guides`): a pure
      `StorySnapResolver.resolve(x, y, …)` → `SnapResult(x, y, verticalGuide, horizontalGuide,
      withinSafeZone)` is the single source of truth for where a dragged element settles. Each axis
      **independently** locks onto the nearest in-range alignment guide (rule-of-thirds + centre)
      within `SNAP_THRESHOLD`; outside it the axis stays at its clamped candidate; a non-finite
      candidate collapses to the canvas centre and out-of-canvas values clamp into `0f..1f`.
      `withinSafeZone` flags a centre that drifts inside the `SAFE_ZONE_INSET` edge margin. The
      existing `onTextElementMoved` drag now routes its resulting centre through the resolver and
      moves the element by the **snap-adjusted** delta (reusing `StorySlideDeck.moveTextElement`,
      no new reducer), exposing the live guides + safe-zone verdict as transient
      `StoryComposerUiState.snapFeedback` (cleared by `onTextElementDragEnd` on lift). The canvas
      draws the active guide line(s) (accent `primary`) and an `error`-coloured warning border when
      out of bounds; the drag-end signal is a non-consuming `Final`-pass `awaitEachGesture` that
      runs alongside the transform detector (glue). A natural magnetic-alignment gesture — surpasses
      iOS, whose snapping has no per-axis guide overlay here. +25 tests (18 resolver, 7 VM). Pending:
      frosted-glass text backdrops, persistent safe-zone overlay grid.
- [x] Z-order management (front/back, forward/backward) persisted for WYSIWYG playback
      (`story-text-element-zorder`): the slide's `elements` list order *is* the paint order (index 0 =
      back, last = front), so a pure `StorySlideDeck.reorderTextElement(id, StoryZOrder)` restacks the
      element within its holding slide — `TO_BACK`/`TO_FRONT` jump to either end, `BACKWARD`/`FORWARD`
      step one place (target index `coerceIn`-clamped to the list bounds). Inert (same instance) on an
      unknown id, an already-at-the-extreme move, or a single-element slide; only the holding slide is
      restacked and the selection is preserved. `StoryComposerViewModel.onReorderTextElement` wraps it
      and keeps the same state instance on an inert move (no recomposition churn). The floating
      `TextStyleToolbar` gains a 4-button z-order row (send-to-back / backward / forward / bring-to-front)
      whose order rides into publish via the existing element serialisation. +16 tests (13 reducer, 3 VM);
      +4 strings × 4 locales. Mirrors iOS's front/back + forward/backward layering controls.
- [~] Multi-element context menu (edit, duplicate, reorder, delete) — **edit** (tap-to-select +
      caption/element routing), **delete** (per-element remove handle), **duplicate**
      (`story-text-element-duplicate`), and **reorder** (`story-text-element-zorder`, z-order row in the
      floating toolbar) done. Duplicate: pure `StorySlideDeck.duplicateTextElement`
      clones every styled field as a fresh id right after the source on its slide, nudged by a small
      normalised offset (clamped into the canvas) so the copy is visible, inert when the source id is
      unknown / the new id collides / the slide is at the ≤5 cap; `StoryComposerViewModel.onDuplicateTextElement`
      mints the id, selects the copy, and warns-without-adding at the cap; a duplicate `ContentCopy`
      handle sits in the floating `TextStyleToolbar`. Pending: a single unified long-press context menu
      consolidating these per-element actions.
- [ ] Per-element + per-slide duration; background designation toggle (1 visual + 1 audio/slide)
- [ ] Repost flow: clone source story + locked attribution badge
- [ ] Draft save/restore with media persistence + lost-media detection / re-capture prompt
- [~] Offline publish queue done (durable outbox `PUBLISH_STORY` lane, auto-retry on
      reconnect via `OutboxFlushWorker`); **failed-publish recovery** done (exhausted publishes
      surface a Retry/Discard strip above the tray — no silent loss); preview-before-publish and
      RAW background publish-all still pending.
- [x] Visibility selection (Public / Friends / Community / Private) — accent `FilterChip` row
      in the composer; wire value carried on `StoryVisibility.wire` → `CreateStoryRequest.visibility`.
- [ ] thumbHash blur-placeholder generation per slide
- [ ] **V2 timeline editor**: multi-track, Quick + Pro modes, size-class adaptive, zoomable
- [ ] Clip add / move / trim / split / delete with full undo/redo (command stack, FIFO 50, persisted)
- [ ] Keyframe animation (position/scale/opacity, easing) per clip/element

- [~] **Story viewer**: tap-advance + swipe (horizontal=group, vertical=dismiss), segmented
      progress bars, cross-dissolve transitions, per-story opening/closing effects
      — done: pure cross-group **`StoryPlayback`** engine (tap-advance rolls between
      authors, rolls back to the previous group's last slide, dismisses past the
      last slide of the last group; `jumpToNext/PreviousGroup` ready for swipes),
      wired into `StoryViewerViewModel`/`StoryViewerScreen` with segmented progress
      + timed auto-advance; **swipe gestures wired** (pure `StorySwipeResolver`
      maps a drag → `NextGroup`/`PreviousGroup`/`Dismiss`/`None` on the dominant
      axis, dispatched through `StoryViewerViewModel.onSwipe` into the engine's
      `jumpToNext/PreviousGroup` + new `StoryPlayback.dismissed()`). Pending:
      cross-dissolve transitions, per-story opening/closing effects.
- [x] Timed auto-advance gated on media-load readiness; adjacent-slide prefetch (sliding window).
      **Adjacent-slide prefetch**: pure `StoryPrefetchPlanner.plan(playback, lookahead=2)`
      returns the next N distinct image URLs ahead of the current slide in viewing order,
      continuing across author-group boundaries and skipping text-only slides; exposed as
      `StoryViewerUiState.prefetchUrls`, enqueued through the shared Coil `ImageLoader` in
      `StoryViewerScreen` so the next slide paints from cache (Instant-App — surpasses iOS's
      single-next preload). **Media-load gate** (closes the loop): pure
      `StoryAutoAdvanceGate.shouldCountdown(slide, resolvedImageUrls)` — text-only slides count
      down at once, an image slide waits until its URL has resolved (load *or* error → never
      hangs). `StoryViewerViewModel` tracks resolved URLs from `AsyncImage` `onSuccess`/`onError`
      and exposes `canAutoAdvance`; the screen's countdown `LaunchedEffect` holds at empty until
      the gate opens. Surpasses iOS, which starts its 5s timer on appearance regardless of paint.
- [ ] Story content rendering: text/positioning/background/filters/media overlays
- [~] Story reactions: emoji quick-strip + full picker, big floating animation, heart bounce, count
      — done: pure **`StoryReactionState`** reducer (optimistic local tap + idempotent
      reconciliation with realtime `story:reacted`/`unreacted` deltas, count clamped ≥0,
      `mine` set = iOS `currentUserReactions`); `StoryViewerViewModel.react()` does an
      **optimistic** bump with rollback-on-failure (better than iOS fire-and-forget),
      per-slide state; `ReactionStrip` quick-emoji row (`EmojiCatalog.defaultQuickReactions`)
      + live total-count badge in `StoryViewerScreen`; **realtime socket-delta wiring done**
      — `SocialSocketManager.storyReacted`/`storyUnreacted` flows decoded from
      `story:reacted`/`story:unreacted`, `StoryViewerViewModel` collects both and folds
      them through `applyDelta` (own-echo de-duped vs the optimistic bump, unknown/non-current
      slides handled). Pending: full categorised picker, big floating animation,
      heart bounce, server-side `currentUserReactions` seeding, social-socket `attach()`
      lifecycle wiring (app-wide, separate slice).
- [ ] Story comments overlay: live-chat panel, 1-level threading, composer with effects/blur,
      per-comment language switcher, optimistic posting + reaction likes
- [ ] Story actions: reply privately (DM with context), forward/send, reshare-as-story,
      repost-as-post (direct + edit), mute/unmute, translate, report
- [~] Story viewers sheet (who-viewed list with reaction/reshare indicators)
      — done: `StoryRepository.viewers()` (`GET posts/{id}/interactions` → wire
      `StoryViewersResponse` mapped to domain `StoryViewer` via pure
      `toStoryViewer()`, displayName/avatar/reaction blank-collapse > iOS nil-only
      check); pure `StoryViewersPresentation.order()` (most-recent-first, null
      timestamps last, defensive dedup-by-id > iOS raw order); `StoryViewersViewModel`
      (cold-only skeleton, refresh keeps the list & swallows refresh failures,
      error only on cold, re-entrancy-guarded) + `StoryViewersSheet` (ModalBottomSheet,
      accent-coherent, avatar rows, empty/error/loading states) reachable via an
      author-only "Views" button in `StoryViewerScreen` (timer pauses while open).
      Pending: reaction/reshare indicators richness, realtime `story:viewed` append
      (socket payload lacks viewer name/avatar to render a row — needs API or a
      user lookup), reshare indicator.
- [ ] Reader Prisme: text overlays in viewer's preferred language; composer shows source language
- [ ] **Author-only Story → MP4 export** (bit-exact render, language picker, system share, never uploaded)
- [ ] Single shared renderer feeds composer canvas + reader canvas + export compositor (WYSIWYG)
- [ ] Accessibility for canvas elements (labels, custom delete/duplicate/reorder actions)

## F. Feed & Posts
- [~] Social feed: cache-first SWR list + pull-to-refresh + cursor-paginated infinite
      scroll done (`PostRepository.feedStream`/`loadMore`/`feedHasMore`, skeleton on cold
      cache, silent background revalidation, 5-from-tail prefetch + footer spinner,
      dedupe-append, history pages do not bump the freshness watermark) ; new-posts banner
      + realtime-head merge pending
- [x] Post reactions (heart like) — **optimistic** toggle via `PostRepository.toggleLike`
      (flips `isLikedByMe` + count instantly, rolls back on failure). Fixes the prior
      bug where any post liked by *others* rendered as liked-by-me (`likeCount > 0`
      proxy removed). UI like state now reads the viewer's own `isLikedByMe`.
- [x] Adaptive multi-image collage layouts (1–4 + overlay « +N ») in the feed card
      (single full-width with aspect ratio, 2-col grid otherwise) — `FeedPostBuilder`
      resolves + orders image media and resolves relative URLs against the gateway origin
- [~] Prisme Linguistique on the feed: post content rendered in the viewer's preferred
      language with a discreet « Traduit » indicator (`ApiPost.displayContent`/`isTranslated`
      port of the message Prisme rules — Map-keyed translations, Rule 1 honoured) ;
      per-post flag strip / request-missing-languages pending
- [x] Feed card stats row: like (filled when own) + comment count + repost count,
      mood emoji on the author line, pure `FeedPostPresentation` builder (8 builder
      tests + 1 model Prisme test + 3 repository optimistic/rollback tests, all green)
- [~] Social feed: cursor-paginated post list + infinite scroll done (see above) ;
      new-posts banner pending
- [ ] Feed overlay shell with draggable floating buttons + radial menu ladder
- [ ] Create post (text, photos/videos, camera, files, location, audio+transcription, visibility, language)
- [ ] Unified post composer (Post / Status / Story tabs)
- [ ] Quote / repost posts (incl. reposts of stories) with canvas reprojection + "items repositioned" banner
- [ ] Post reactions (heart like) — optimistic + live socket sync; bookmark / un-bookmark
- [ ] Adaptive multi-image collage layouts (1–5+ media) + fullscreen gallery
- [ ] Threaded comments: auto-preview replies, expand threads ("view N more"), comment likes,
      mentions, effects/blur, per-comment language switcher
- [ ] Post / comment pin-unpin; repost / quote-repost / share; report
- [ ] Post view + dwell-time tracking; batched impression tracking
- [ ] Feed post detail with text/media/repost, translation flags, threaded comments
- [ ] User-profile posts feed + community posts feed
- [ ] Bookmarked posts feed (saved posts) with infinite scroll
- [ ] Post-detail room real-time subscriptions
- [ ] Story repost-embed cell in the feed

## G. Statuses / Moods
- [ ] Statuses/moods bar: emoji pills, popover details, infinite scroll
- [ ] Status composer / republish: emoji grid, 122-char text, visibility (public/friends/except/only)
- [ ] Mood status create, react, delete; 21h expiry + viewer tracking
- [ ] Status thought-bubble popover on avatar tap with republish action
- [ ] Friends / Discover status feeds

## H. Calls (audio / video)
- [ ] 1:1 audio & video calls (WebRTC P2P, ICE/STUN, hardware H.264)
- [ ] System call UI (Telecom/ConnectionService) + ringback tone
- [ ] Incoming-call delivery via FCM data push when backgrounded/killed (full-screen intent)
- [ ] Call reconnection on network change (ICE restart)
- [~] Call states: ringing/connecting/connected/ended; PiP / floating call pill —
      **pure call-lifecycle FSM landed** (`core:model` `me.meeshy.sdk.model.call`):
      `CallState` (Idle/Ringing(isOutgoing)/Offering/Connecting/Connected/Reconnecting(attempt)/
      Ended(reason)) + `CallEndReason` (Local/Remote/Rejected/Missed/ConnectionLost/Failed(msg)) +
      `CallEvent` + total side-effect-free `CallStateMachine.reduce(state, event)` faithfully
      mirroring iOS `CallManager`/`WebRTCTypes` transitions (incl. the 3-attempt reconnect budget →
      `ConnectionLost`). SSOT the `:feature:calls` wiring will drive — surpasses iOS, where the FSM
      validator is only a P1 todo. 31 behavioural tests. PiP/call-pill UI + the WebRTC plumbing pending.
      **`:feature:calls` now consumes the FSM** (slice `calls-viewmodel-screen`): a UDF `CallViewModel`
      (`StateFlow<CallUiState>`) folds accept/decline/hang-up/mute/camera intents + signalling events
      through `CallStateMachine.reduce`, with a pure `CallPresenter` projecting `CallState × CallConfig ×
      CallMedia → CallUiState` (status/answer/hang-up/media-toggle affordances, end-reason label,
      reconnect attempt). A minimal accent-coherent Compose call screen renders ringing/connecting/
      connected/ended and is reachable from **audio/video call buttons in the chat header** (iOS parity);
      dismissal returns to chat. +34 behavioural tests. WebRTC/signalling plumbing still pending.
- [ ] Live in-call transcription overlay (on-device speech-to-text, leader/follower)
- [ ] In-call translation data channel (dual-stream clean audio)
- [ ] In-call video filters (colour presets, low-light boost, background blur, skin smoothing)
- [ ] In-call audio effects (voice changer, baby/demon voice, looping background sound)
- [ ] Camera-covered ("dark frame") detection during video calls
- [ ] Thermal-aware quality degradation (fps/resolution caps, video disable)
- [ ] Adaptive call quality (bitrate ladder, auto video-disable on critical link)
- [ ] Connection-quality indicator; call-waiting banner (second incoming call)
- [ ] Front-camera mirroring; extensible call media pipeline hook bus
- [~] Voice/video call signaling events (initiate, answer, ICE, end, missed, media toggle) —
      **inbound event models + pure frame→`CallEvent` mapper landed** (slice `call-signalling-events`):
      `core:model` `me.meeshy.sdk.model.call` gains `@Serializable` payload types at parity with the iOS
      `MessageSocketManager` listen table (`CallInitiatedPayload`/`CallSignalEnvelope`+`CallSignalPayload`/
      `CallParticipantPayload`/`CallEndedPayload`/`CallMissedPayload`/`CallMediaTogglePayload`/
      `CallErrorPayload`/`CallAlreadyAnsweredPayload`) plus a total, side-effect-free `CallSignalMapper.map(
      eventName, rawJson)` routing each `call:*` frame into the FSM vocabulary: `call:initiated`→
      `ReceiveIncoming`, `call:participant-joined`→`ParticipantJoined`, `call:signal` type=`answer`→
      `RemoteAnswer` (offer/ice-candidate inert), `call:ended` reason=`missed`→`RingTimeout` else
      `RemoteHangUp`, `call:missed`→`RingTimeout`, `call:error`→`ConnectionFailed(msg)`,
      `call:already-answered`→`RemoteHangUp`; `call:media-toggled` + malformed/unknown frames → `null`
      (inert, never crashes). +22 behavioural tests. VM/socket subscription wiring + outbound emit table
      still pending.
