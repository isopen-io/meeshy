# Notes — lessons & memory

Append-only log of gotchas and decisions that save time next run.

## Environment
- Fresh container has **no Android SDK**. Install per `ROUTINE.md` recipe (~2 min).
- JDK 21 preinstalled; modules target JVM 17 — fine.
- First Gradle run downloads the whole toolchain (slow); run it in the
  background and poll the output file.
- `./apps/android/meeshy.sh check` = `assembleDebug` + `testDebugUnitTest`.
  Full clean check ≈ 2.5 min once dependencies are cached.

## Test patterns (established in repo)
- ViewModel tests: `UnconfinedTestDispatcher` + `Dispatchers.setMain/resetMain`
  in `@Before/@After`; Truth `assertThat`; MockK (`relaxed = true`); Turbine
  `state.test {}` for flow assertions.
- `MeeshyConfig` is a plain `data class` with defaults — instantiate it real,
  do not mock.
- `SessionRepository` is a concrete class — mock with `mockk(relaxed=true)` and
  stub `currentUser` (a `MutableStateFlow`) and `currentUserId` explicitly.
- `NetworkResult.Failure` wraps **`ApiError(message, code?, httpStatus?)`** — not
  a `NetworkError` type. Use `NetworkResult.Success(Unit)` for unit endpoints.

## Domain gotchas
- `List<ApiPost>.toStoryGroups()` orders each group's stories **oldest-first**
  (ascending `createdAt`); groups order = current-user → unviewed → latest desc.
  When building viewer fixtures, the *first* slide is the *oldest* story.
- Prisme rule 1: when no translation matches a preferred language, show the
  ORIGINAL (`isTranslated = false`) — never an arbitrary translation. Honoured by
  `StoryContentResolver` / `LanguageResolver.preferredTranslation`.

## Decisions
- **Routine docs live in `apps/android/tasks/android-routine/`** (not repo-root
  `tasks/`) so merged diffs stay inside `apps/android` per the hard merge gate.
- Cross-group story navigation is modelled as a **pure `StoryPlayback`** reducer
  in `:feature:stories`; the ViewModel holds an instance and re-derives
  `UiState` from it, the Composable only wires gestures + the auto-advance timer
  and observes `isDismissed` to pop. Keeps all branch logic JVM-testable.

## Open follow-ups (cross-slice)
- Wire **Kover** with a 90% per-module verification rule.
- Add a dedicated **Android CI workflow** (touches `.github/` → separate run).
- Story viewer richness: horizontal swipe = group jump (engine already supports
  `jumpToNext/PreviousGroup`), vertical swipe = dismiss, reactions strip,
  comments overlay, viewers sheet, media prefetch, SWR/Room backing for the tray.
