# Progress — state & what to do next

## Current build-order position

`Auth ✅ → Conversations ✅ → Chat ✅ → Feed ✅ → **Stories (in progress)** → Calls → rest`

Stories so far: tray (ring carousel) + cross-group viewer playback engine
shipped earlier loops; this loop adds the **quick-reaction strip** (optimistic
count + rollback) to the viewer.

## Next slice (pick one for the next run)

Ordered by value within the Stories area:
1. `story-viewer-swipe-gestures` — wire horizontal swipe → `jumpToNext/PreviousGroup`
   (engine already supports it) and vertical drag → dismiss; instrumentation-free
   logic lives in the engine, Composable wires the gesture.
2. `story-reaction-socket-delta` — wire `story:reacted`/`story:unreacted` realtime
   events into `StoryReactionState.applyDelta` (reducer already supports it) so other
   users' reactions update the open viewer live; seed `mine` from server
   `currentUserReactions` once the API exposes it.
3. `story-tray-swr` — Room/SWR backing for the tray so it is genuinely
   cache-first (skeleton only on cold empty), per Instant-App principles.
4. `story-composer` — publish flow (text/media) via the outbox/WorkManager chain.

After Stories richness is sufficient, advance to the **Calls** area
(`feature-parity.md` §"Calls").

## Run log

### 2026-06-22 — slice `story-viewer-reactions` ✅
- **Branch:** `claude/apps/android/story-viewer-reactions`
- **What:** quick-reaction strip on the story viewer with an **optimistic** count
  and rollback-on-failure (iOS `sendReaction` is fire-and-forget; Android does
  better). Parity with iOS quick emojis + `currentUserReactions`.
- **Added (production):**
  - `StoryReactionState.kt` — pure reducer: `reactedLocally(emoji)` (additive,
    idempotent per emoji), `applyDelta(emoji, delta, isOwn)` (realtime
    `story:reacted`/`unreacted` reconciliation; own-add idempotent vs the
    optimistic count; count clamped ≥0; `mine` set tracks the user's emojis).
  - `StoryViewerViewModel.react(emoji)` — snapshot → optimistic apply → emit →
    `storyRepository.react` → rollback on `Failure`/exception; per-slide state
    map; idempotent repeat taps skip the network. `StoryViewerUiState` gains
    `reactionCount`/`myReactions`/`quickReactions`; `StorySlideView` gains
    `reactionCount` (seeded from `reactionSummary` via `toStoryGroups`).
  - `StoryViewerScreen` `ReactionStrip` — accent-coherent emoji row over the nav
    bar (`EmojiCatalog.defaultQuickReactions`), selected-emoji highlight, taps
    consumed so they never leak to the advance/back gesture behind it.
- **Tests:** +11 `StoryReactionStateTest` (every reducer branch: local add /
  idempotent / distinct emoji / others' add / own-add idempotent / own-add
  un-optimistic / removal own & others / clamp-at-0 / zero-delta inert / empty)
  and +5 `StoryViewerViewModelTest` (optimistic bump+mine+calls repo / failure
  rollback / idempotent twice = 1 network call / per-slide isolation / strip
  exposed). 22 stories tests in the two files green.
- **Edge cases covered:** empty/zero base, idempotent repeat, switch emoji,
  own vs others' deltas, count never negative, zero-delta inert, network failure
  → graceful rollback (`CancellationException` rethrown), per-slide state reset.
- **Verify:** `./apps/android/meeshy.sh check` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 5m44s
  (full `assembleDebug` + all JVM unit tests across modules);
  `StoryReactionStateTest` 11/0/0, `StoryViewerViewModelTest` 11/0/0.
- **Reviewer:** PASS — scope `apps/android` only; behavioural tests, no
  tautologies; SDK purity (the "when/how to count optimistically" rule lives in
  `:feature:stories`, not the SDK); UDF + immutable `UiState`; single source of
  truth for emojis (`EmojiCatalog`) and accent visuals; no dead ends.

### 2026-06-22 — slice `story-viewer-playback` ✅ merged-pending
- **Branch:** `claude/apps/android/story-viewer-playback`
- **What:** pure cross-group story-viewer navigation engine + ViewModel/Screen
  rewire so tap-advance rolls between authors and dismisses past the last slide
  (parity with iOS `StoryViewerView`).
- **Added (production):** `StoryPlayback.kt` (`StoryPlayback` + `StoryGroupSlides`,
  pure transitions `advance/back/jumpToNextGroup/jumpToPreviousGroup` +
  `startingAt`). Rewired `StoryViewerViewModel` to load **all** groups and derive
  `UiState` from the engine (added `groupIndex`, `isDismissed`). Rewired
  `StoryViewerScreen` auto-advance/tap to the engine + `isDismissed` → `onClose`.
- **Tests:** +13 (`StoryPlaybackTest`, 22 cases over startingAt/advance/back/
  jumps/derived accessors — every `when` arm incl. inert/boundary) and
  +6 (`StoryViewerViewModelTest`: load-positions, advance roll-over, dismiss-at-end,
  back roll-back, markViewed, failed-load graceful). 35 stories tests green.
- **Edge cases covered:** unknown start user → group 0; empty-slide groups dropped;
  dismiss is inert; back at very first slice is a no-op; oldest-first slide order;
  network failure → `isLoading=false`, not dismissed.
- **Verify:** `./apps/android/meeshy.sh check` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL (full assemble +
  all JVM unit tests across modules).
- **Reviewer:** PASS — scope is `apps/android` only; behavioural tests, no
  tautologies; SDK purity kept (engine in `:feature:stories`, not SDK, since it
  composes app-side `StorySlideView`); UDF + accent-coherent viewer, no dead end.
- **Also (bootstrap):** created `apps/android/tasks/android-routine/{ROUTINE,
  PROGRESS,REVIEWER,TDD-COVERAGE,NOTES}.md`.

## Blocked / risks
- No Android CI workflow → CI green is the JS/Python monorepo suite; local
  `meeshy.sh check` is the real Android gate. (Follow-up: add Android CI.)
- No Kover/Jacoco gate wired → coverage is a discipline (see `TDD-COVERAGE.md`).
