/**
 * Pure lifecycle logic for revealing a blurred / view-once message — a direct port of
 * iOS `BubbleBlurRevealLifecycle` plus the reveal→re-conceal sequence encoded
 * imperatively in `BubbleBlurRevealController.scheduleReveal()`
 * (`BubbleBlurRevealLifecycle.swift`).
 *
 * A blurred bubble hides its content behind a fog + blur; tapping it reveals the
 * content for a visibility window, after which the fog condenses back in, the blur
 * re-applies behind it, and the fog dissipates — leaving the content concealed again.
 *
 * iOS buries that animation inside a `Task`, so its timing is untestable. Here the
 * whole sequence is the pure, fully-testable [revealTimeline] (a deliberate
 * improvement over iOS); the Compose layer only replays these keyframes off the clock.
